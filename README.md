# Farm-to-Table E-commerce Website

## Overview

The "Farm-to-Table" project aims to create an e-commerce platform that connects consumers directly with farmers, facilitated by the Department of Agriculture (DA). This is a project in CMSC 100 - Web Programming at the University of the Philppines Los Ba√±os showcasing the students mastery on creating a functional website with a server, database and user interface. 

## How To Run?
- **Install Dependencies:**
    - Open a terminal and navigate to the **API/MongoDB** folder and type in ```npm i``` to install dependencie on the server side. 
    - Navigate to the **react** folder and type in ```npm i``` to install dependencie on the client side. 
- **Run the App**
    - Create two terminals dedicated to both the client and server side.
    - In the first terminal, navigate to the **API/MongoDB** folder and type in ```node index.js``` or ```npm run dev``` to initiate the server. Without this, majority of the client side will not work.
    - In the second terminal, navigate to the **react** folder and type in ```npm start```. This shall initialize the website and should automatically open a browser to [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/).
